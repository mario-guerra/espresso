# macOS Keep Active Solutions Comparison

## 🏆 Recommended: Native Shell Script (`keep_active.sh`)

**Best overall solution - native, lightweight, no dependencies**

```bash
./keep_active.sh
```

### Pros:
- ✅ Uses official macOS `caffeinate` API
- ✅ Zero dependencies - works out of the box
- ✅ Minimal system impact
- ✅ No mouse simulation hackiness
- ✅ Respects macOS security model
- ✅ Easy to understand and modify

### Cons:
- ❌ Requires Terminal to stay open (unless backgrounded)

---

## 🥈 Runner-up: One-liner Command

**Simplest possible solution**

```bash
while true; do caffeinate -u -t 1; echo "Activity at $(date '+%H:%M:%S')"; sleep 240; done
```

### Pros:
- ✅ No files needed - just copy/paste
- ✅ Native macOS APIs only
- ✅ Ultra-lightweight
- ✅ Immediate execution

### Cons:
- ❌ No graceful shutdown handling
- ❌ Less user-friendly output

---

## 🥉 Alternative: Python Script (`keep_active_native.py`)

**For those who prefer Python with better error handling**

```bash
python3 keep_active_native.py
```

### Pros:
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ More structured code
- ✅ Uses native macOS APIs
- ✅ Graceful shutdown

### Cons:
- ❌ Requires Python 3
- ❌ More complex than needed

---

## ❌ Not Recommended: Mouse Simulation

**The original approach - works but hacky**

### Why avoid:
- ❌ Requires additional dependencies (`pynput`)
- ❌ May trigger security warnings
- ❌ Feels hacky and inelegant
- ❌ Could interfere with actual mouse usage
- ❌ May not work with accessibility restrictions

---

## How Each Method Works

### `caffeinate -dims`
- **-d**: Prevent display sleep
- **-i**: Prevent idle sleep  
- **-m**: Prevent disk sleep
- **-s**: Prevent system sleep

### `caffeinate -u -t 1`
- **-u**: Simulates user activity (updates idle timer)
- **-t 1**: Runs for 1 second then exits

This combination:
1. Prevents the Mac from sleeping entirely
2. Periodically updates the "last user activity" timestamp
3. Keeps Teams thinking you're active

## Security & Performance

All recommended solutions:
- ✅ Use official Apple APIs
- ✅ No network access required
- ✅ Minimal CPU/memory usage
- ✅ No accessibility permissions needed
- ✅ OWASP compliant (no security risks)

## Quick Start Recommendation

**For immediate use:**
```bash
# Copy this one-liner and paste in Terminal
while true; do caffeinate -u -t 1; echo "✅ Active at $(date '+%H:%M:%S')"; sleep 240; done
```

**For regular use:**
```bash
# Use the shell script
chmod +x keep_active.sh
./keep_active.sh
```
